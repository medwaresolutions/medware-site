  'What I Learned After 12,000 Hours with AI',
  '12000-hours',
  E'At the end of last year, I promised on LinkedIn that I''d run an AI training course. Life got in the way — client work, product launches, the usual chaos of running a health tech company in Sydney.\n\nSo here''s the next best thing: everything I''ve learned after 12,000+ hours with AI, written down properly.\n\nI was in my 50s with no formal developer training when I first opened ChatGPT in November 2022. Three years later, I''ve built and shipped multiple production software products — Medflow (clinical workflow management) and Medcast (medical education media). Real products, used by real businesses.\n\nI''m not writing this to impress anyone. I''m writing it because most of what you read about AI is either breathless hype or academic jargon, and neither helps if you''re trying to actually use the stuff.\n\nThis is what I''ve learned. Practically. From the trenches.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Basics Nobody Explains Well\n\nLet''s start with what these things actually are, because most explanations are either dumbed down to uselessness or buried in technical language.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are pattern-completion engines. They''ve been trained on enormous amounts of text — books, code, websites, conversations — and they''ve learned to predict what comes next in a sequence. That''s fundamentally it. They don''t "think" the way you and I do. They''re extraordinarily sophisticated pattern matchers.\n\nBut here''s what that undersells: the patterns they''ve learned are so rich and so deep that the output often looks indistinguishable from genuine reasoning.\n\n**The major players right now:**\n\n**Claude** (made by Anthropic) is my go-to for coding and complex reasoning.\n\n**GPT** (OpenAI) is the household name. Strong all-rounder, particularly good for writing tasks.\n\n**Gemini** (Google) has a massive context window — great for research and analysis.\n\n**Llama** (Meta) is open source, important for privacy-sensitive work.\n\n**Grok** (xAI) is the newest serious contender. Strong reasoning, real-time web access.\n\n**DeepSeek** shocked the industry with models that rival the best at a fraction of the training cost.\n\nI learned all of this in my 50s. Age is irrelevant. Curiosity isn''t.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Is an Agent and Why It Matters\n\nFor my first year with AI, I was a copy-paste merchant. Then I discovered agents, and everything changed.\n\nAn agent is AI that doesn''t just answer questions — it takes actions. It can read your files, write code, execute commands, browse the web, manage tasks.\n\nThe shift from chatbot to agent is the biggest leap in practical AI usefulness I''ve experienced. If you''re still just having conversations with AI, you''re using maybe 10% of what''s available.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Right AI for the Right Job\n\n**For coding:** Claude, and it''s not close.\n\n**For general writing:** GPT still has the smoothest output.\n\n**For research and large documents:** Gemini.\n\n**For images:** Midjourney for artistic, Flux for photorealism.\n\n**For video:** Sora and Runway are leading the pack.\n\nThe real skill isn''t knowing which model is "best." It''s knowing which model to reach for based on what you''re doing right now.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What Nobody Tells You About Using AI Well\n\n**Don''t chase a poor response. Just start again.**\n\nWhen an AI gives you a mediocre or wrong answer, your instinct is to correct it. But often the AI has committed to an approach, and it will keep trying to make that approach work.\n\nThe fix? Start a fresh conversation. Give it a cleaner prompt with better context.\n\n**Prompting is a real skill.** The gap between people who say "AI is overhyped" and people who say "AI changed my life" is almost always the gap in how they use it.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Measure Twice, Cut Once\n\nThis lesson cost me hundreds of hours before I learned it.\n\nI started planning first. Not big, formal planning documents. Just 10 minutes of structured thinking before touching any code. The difference was dramatic.\n\n**Framewright** ([framewright.site](https://framewright.site)) is a free, open-source planning tool that helps you create structured specifications before you write code.\n\n---\n\n## 6. What''s Possible Now and What''s Coming\n\nToday — just over three years later:\n\n- AI writes production-quality code across full-stack applications.\n- Image generation is indistinguishable from photography in many cases.\n- Video generation produces cinematic-quality footage from text descriptions.\n- AI agents manage complex multi-step workflows with minimal oversight.\n- A 60-year-old non-developer has multiple production software products in the market.\n\n**What this means for non-developers:** If you have domain expertise, you can now build the tools your industry actually needs.\n\n---\n\n## Where This Leaves Us\n\nThree years ago, building software required years of training. Now it requires clarity of thought and willingness to learn.\n\nI started in my 50s with no coding background, and now I have production software in the market.\n\n**The best time to start was three years ago. The second best time is today.**',
